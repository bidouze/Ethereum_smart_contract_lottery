#📝 Smart_contract_lottery

This project is an ongoing experiment where I learn to write and deploy smart contracts to the test Rinkeby Eth Network. To start, a relatively "easy" use case have been decided : a lottery smart contract where anyone can enter with at least 0.1 ETH and only the manager of the lottery can pick the winner.
